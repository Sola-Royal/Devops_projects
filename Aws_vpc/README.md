# **Network mastry with AWS VPC mini project**

>**This mini project is to explore the core concept of amazon (AWS), focusing specifically on virtual private Cloud(VPCs).**

>__This project is to document the understanding of VPC, from fundamental components of VPC infrastructure, including subneta, gateways, and routing tables.__

**What is VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway?**

**VPC**
_VPC is all about creating a private room in the cloud just so that computer can comminucate securely_ 
_In the VPC we have different sections called subnets, for different parts of the business_

_Internet Gateway let the VPc communicate securely_

_NAT Gatewway is a secret agent between computer and the internet. NAT gateway translate the computer's message and send it out without know who sent the message from office_

_Then name your NAT gateway_
![.](./Img/4.701.jpg)
_Now, choose the private subnet because of annonymous message for security purpose_
![.](./Img/4.622222%20pri.jpg)

_press Create button to create the natgateway_
![.](./Img/4.71.jpg)

_Nat gateway created successfully_
![.](./Img/4.72.jpg)

_Select the NAT gateway, naviagte to the "Details tab". locate the subnet ID and click on it_
![.](./Img/4.73.jpg)

_In the subnet page, navigate to the `"Route Table"` section, then click `route ID`_
![.](./Img/4.74.jpg)

_proceed to the `Routes` section, then click on `edit routes`_
![.](./Img/4.75.jpg)

__Then Click on `Add routes`__
![.](./Img/4.76.jpg)

_Select  `Destination` as `0.0.0.0/0`_ then target field, choose `NAT Gateway`, Then select the NAT gateway you created. Finally, save the the change

>**Different between Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway**

* `The Internet gateway` is a subnet that allow inflow and outflow of resouces like EC2 instaces. 
* `NAT gateway` is a oneway traffic that only deal with inflow but no outflow because of its sensitivity. the subnet connect to the internet but it does not allow incoming traffic.

# **VPC peering Connetion**
_vpc peering is like peering two virtual office in the cloud so that they can talk to each other directly without going through through a middleman_

* By default, EC2 instance in different VPCs cannt communicate with each other.
* To enable the communication between EC2 instances in differnt VPCa, you can set up `peering`, VPN connections, or AWS Direct Connect.

# **VPC peering Connetion**
We need to do peering if we want different part of our Cloud network (VPCs) to walk with each other smootjly. for example, you have one VPC  for development and other for Marketing team, and you want them to share data securely. that is where VPC peering comes in handy. it lets these VPCs to communicate directly, making things easier for everyone.

> # **Part-6**
## __Practical part of it by begin of creating two VPC either in the same region or different region__
![alt text](image-3.png)
![alt text](image-4.png)

__The both peering VPC created sucessfully__
![alt text](image-5.png)


- _Navigate to the `peering connection sidebar` option in the left_
- _Upon clicking, you'll be directed to the VPC peering page._
- _From there, proceed to click on the `Creating peering Connection` button
![alt text](image-6.png)

- _Now, provide a name for the VPC peering connection_
- _Select the requester VPC_
- _Choose the account `MY account` since the VPCs are in our own AWS account_
- _ ensure to use the same region, `This region(eu-north-1),` as the VPCs created in the same region_
- _Next, accepter VPC_
- proceed by clicking on the`Create peering Connection` button
![alt text](image-7.png)
![alt text](image-8.png)

- __Then you will see__
![alt text](image-9.png)

- __In the peering Connection page, locate the `Actions` option on the right side.__

- _Click on it, then select `Accept Request`_
![alt text](image-10.png)

_Click on `Accept request`_
![alt text](image-11.png)

_Click on Main route tale ID of the accepter VPC_
![alt text](image-12.png)

- _Choose the route table._
- _Then navigate to the `Routes`_ section.
- Click on `Edit route`
![alt text](image-13.png)

- _Click on add route_
![alt text](image-14.png)

_Input request VPC IPv$ CIDR. in case - 192.168.0.0/16, copy it and paste it in the `Destination` field when adding a route_
![alt text](image-16.png)

in the target, choose VPC peering and then choose the peerin g connection you have created. Click on save changes._
![alt text](image-15.png)
_successfully created_

- _Now, copy IPv4 CIDR of the accepter VPC. in this case- 172.16.0.0/16_
![alt text](image-19.png)

_Now, Click on Main route table ID of the requester VPC
![alt text](image-20.png)_


_Choose the route table, then navigate to the `routes` section. Click on `Edit route`_
![alt text](image-21.png)
_Click on add route._


![alt text](image-22.png)

Created successfully
![alt text](image-23.png)

__The rescouces in the accepter VPC can connect to resources in requester VPC, and vice versa__
![alt text](image-24.png)

## **point**
_VPC peering allows direct communication between two VPCs using private IP addresses. Region compatibility: VPC peering can be set up between VPCs in thre same AWS or different regions and the same AWS account or different AWS account._

> # **__VPC endpoint__**
![alt text](image-27.png)

**The problem**
_if you are trying to backup data from EC2 instances to S# bucket, it will usually pass internet and if the information are sensitive which hacker can take advantage of, so is risk._
![alt text](image-28.png)

_To avoid this risk, we can use something called VPC endpoints. this endpoint make a private connection between the VPC and S3, so the data does not have to go over the internet. so, this way it  is secured from the hacker_
